# Fast-Dictionary

Implementation of a dictionary that contains words with their relevant description and allows the user to populate it with large amounts of information and still remain searchable in an acceptable and efficient way. The implementation is backed by a trie and the word, meaning information is fetched from a file via file handling.

• Insert, search and delete words in the dictionary.

• Printing the words in an alphabetical manner.

• Prefix searching i.e. all words with the entered prefix will be displayed.

• Nearest neighbor search i.e. shows suggested words if the word you are looking for is not found.
